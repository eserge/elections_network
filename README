Installation (for Ubuntu and Mac OS):
    * sudo aptitude install python python-setuptools git
    * sudo easy_install pip

    * git clone git://github.com/sergkop/elections_network.git CODE_DIR
    * sudo pip install -r CODE_DIR/requirements.txt

    * rename site_settings.py.example to site_settings.py and configure

    * python manage.py syncdb (agree to create superuser)
    * python manage.py init_db

    * 'python manage.py runserver' to run server

    * Log in into admin interface (/admin/) and set proper domain name in the entry of Sites model
    (for loginza to work)

Common problems:
    * Django admin media files are not loaded - make sure /static/admin/* url points to .../django/contrib/admin/media/ folder
      in django code directory


Installation (for Windows):
    * setup Python 2.7, git и Django 1.3.1
    * install setuptools and pip (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip)

    * git clone git://github.com/sergkop/elections_network.git CODE_DIR
    * pip install -r CODE_DIR/requirements.txt

    * rename site_settings.py.example to site_settings.py and configure

    * python manage.py syncdb (agree to create superuser)
    * python manage.py init_db
    * 'python manage.py runserver' to run server

    * Log in into admin interface (/admin/) and set proper domain name in the entry of Sites model
    (for loginza to work)

Common problems:
    * If syncdb step fails with the error in Windows 7

            django.db.utils.DatabaseError: You must not use 8-bit bytestrings unless you use
            a text_factory that can interpret 8-bit bytestrings (like text_factory = str).
            It is highly recommended that you instead just switch your application to Unicode strings.

      it is caused by the presence of non-latin symbols in the name of windows user. This is a known
      problem with Python2.7 and the only known workaround is to user another account with English letters-only usernames.

    * When you login into admin interface (http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/) it can happen, that
      media files haven't loaded (interface looks ugly). Try accessing http://127.0.0.1:8000/static/css/screen/content.css),
      if it shows an error

            UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xe0 in position 0: ordinal not in range(128)

       In this case you need to run regedit, find "HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MIME\Database\Content Type" entry
       and remove all MIMETYPES with non-latin symbols in the name (it must be only "аудио/..." and "видео/...")

General advice:
    * Database is stored in database.sqlite, which you can always delete it and re-run 
      'python manage.py syncdb', 'python manage.py init_db' if something goes wrong.

Deployment:
     -------- Optionally create virtualenv -------
    * sudo pip install virtualenv
    * virtualenv --no-site-packages VIRTUAL_ENV_DIR
    * 'source VIRTUAL_ENV_DIR/bin/activate' (if installed must be run every time before running django server or set VIRTUALENV in site_settings.py)
